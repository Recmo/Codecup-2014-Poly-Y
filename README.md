Codecup-2014-Poly-Y
===================

My entry for the 2014 Codecup Poly-Y competition. See http://www.codecup.nl/intro.php.

It uses Monte Carlo Tree Search implemente on top of an efficient bitboard implementation.
There are very few game specific heuristics implemented, the algorithm should be fairly portable to other games.
